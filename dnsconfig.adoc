= DNS Configuration Requirement
:toc:

In order to send and receive email, the {product-short} MTA must be configured in
DNS with both A and MX records. For sending mail, the MTA uses DNS to
resolve hostnames and email-routing information. To receive mail, the MX
record must be configured correctly to route the message to the mail
server.

During the installation process, {product-name} checks to see if
you have an MX record correctly configured. If it is not, an error is
displayed suggesting that the domain name have an MX record configured
in DNS.

You must configure a relay host if you do not enable DNS. After {product-name} is installed, go to the *administration console*'s
*Global Settings>MTA* tab and:

* Uncheck *Enable DNS lookups*.
* Enter the *relay MTA address* to use for external delivery.

NOTE: Even if a relay host is configured, an MX record is still
required if the {product-name} server is going to receive email
from the Internet.
