= Configuring Multi-Master Replication

Set up multi-master LDAP replication to have a copy of the LDAP
database saved on each server in a group of LDAP servers identified
for multi-master replication (MMR). The database can be updated by
any member of the group. If one master fails, the other masters
continue to update the database.

The {product-short} install program is used to configure the multi-master LDAP
servers. Each master LDAP server is given an unique identifier when
they are configured and `zmlocalconfig` is used to add the ldap server
to the multi- master group.

You can also promote an existing replica to be part of the multi-master group.

== Managing Multiple Master LDAP Servers

When you enable multi-master replication, you assign a server ID to
each master server to identify them in the group. This is used to
distinguish the servers in the group and to help resolve conflicts
that might occur.

In addition, each server is configured to assign internal replication
IDâ€™s that are unique to that specific server. Other LDAP master
server can use the same replication ID, but within the server, these
replication IDs must be unique.

You can run the {product-abbrev} multiple master CLI,
`zmldapquery-mmr` from a specific master to see the server ID for that
master and all multi-master servers that are in the group and to see
the replication ID values for those masters.

On the server, enter the command as:

----
/opt/zimbra/libexec/zmldapquery-mmr
----

Before you can enable the multi-master replication feature, you must
know the hostname of the first secondary master that is being added to
the group. The hostname is entered when you enable the feature. Once
you enable the multi- master replication feature, you do not need to
run the command again.


When `zmlocalconfig` is run the first time, the master LDAP servers
are configured as follows:

* The first master LDAP server ID is set to `1`.
* The master LDAP server is put in a group with a secondary master
that is listening to LDAP on port `389`.
* The replication ID is set to `100` by default on the secondary
  master.
* Writes initiated from the server go to the LDAP _master-1_ by
  default. If LDAP _master-1_ is down, writes move to ldap _master-2_.
.. To enable the feature run:
+
----
./libexec/zmldapenable-mmr -s 1 -m ldap://<<master-2.example.com>>:389/
----
+
.. Once the feature is enabled use the `zmlocalconfig` command to add the
LDAP servers to a group.
+
----
zmlocalconfig -e ldap_master_url="ldap://<<master-1.example.com>>:389 ldap://<<master-2.example.com>>:389"
----
+


== Installing a Secondary Master LDAP Server

The master LDAP server must be running when you install the secondary
LDAP servers. You run the {product-abbrev} install program on the
secondary master LDAP servers to install the LDAP package.

=== Passwords Required to Install the Secondary Master

[NOTE]
====
Before you install a secondary master, you must know the following
passwords:

* {product-short} admin LDAP password
* LDAP replication password
* NGINX LDAP password
* Amavis LDAP password
* Postfix LDAP password

To find these passwords, on the {product-abbrev} server run:

----
zmlocalconfig -s | grep passw | grep ldap
----
====

=== Setting Up a Secondary Master LDAP Server

. Follow steps 1 through 4 in <<starting_multiple_server_install>>
to open a SSH session to the LDAP server, log on to the server
as root, and unpack the {product-short} software.
. Type `Y` and press _Enter_ to install the `zimbra-ldap` package.
. Type `Y`, and press _Enter_ to modify the system. The selected packages are
installed. The Main menu shows the default entries for the LDAP
server.
. Type `1` to display the _Common Configuration_ submenu.
.. Type `2` to change the *LDAP Master host* name to the name of the
primary master's hostname; e.g., _master-1.example.com_.
.. Type `4` to change the *LDAP admin password* to the {product-short} admin
password of the primary master.
.. Type `r` to return to the main menu.
. Type `2` to display the _LDAP configuration_ submenu.
.. Type `4` to change the type to `mmr`.
+
NOTE: Item `5`, _LDAP Server ID_, is set to `2`. If this is the second
master, leave it unchanged. If it the third or later master, select `5`
and update the server ID accordingly.
+
The next four steps are to change the default passwords on this server
to match the passwords on the _master-1_ LDAP server.
+
.. Type `7` to change the _LDAP replication password_.
.. Type `8` to change the _LDAP postfix password_.
.. Type `9` to change the _LDAP amavis password_.
.. Type `10` to change the _LDAP NGINX password_.
.. Type `r` to return to the main menu.
. Type `a` to apply the configuration changes. Press _Enter_ to save
the configuration data.
. When *Save Configuration data to a file* appears, press _Enter_.
. When *The system will be modified - continue?* appears, type `y` and press
_Enter_.
+
NOTE: The server is modified. Installing all the components and configuring the
server can take a few minutes.
+
. When *Installation complete - press return to exit* displays, press
_Enter_. The installation is complete.
. Update the `ldap_master_url` attribute to contain both masters, enter
this new master as the _first_ master in the list.
+
----
zmlocalconfig -e ldap_master_url="ldap://<<master-2.example.com>>:389 ldap://<<master-1.example.com>>:389"
----
+


== Promote Existing Replicas to Multi-Master LDAP Servers

In an existing {product-abbrev} setup where there is already a single master and
multiple replicas, you can promote an existing replica to become a
secondary master.

. On the master LDAP server find the LDAP replication, Postfix,
Amavis, and NGINX passwords.
+
----
zmlocalconfig -s | grep passw | grep ldap
----
+
. Change the LDAP passwords on the server you are promoting to be the
same as the first master LDAP server.
** LDAP replication password = `zmldappasswd -l <password>`
** LDAP postfix password = `zmldappasswd -p <password>`
** LDAP amavis password = `zmldappasswd -a <password>`
** LDAP NGINX password = `zmldappasswd -n <password>`
. Assign the next Server ID to this master. This example is `3`
+
----
/opt/zimbra/libexec/zmldappromote-replica-mmr -s 3
----
+
. Update the `ldap_master_url` attribute to add the master to the
list.
+
----
zmlocalconfig -e ldap_master_url="ldap://<<master-1.example.com>>:389 \
  ldap://<<master-2.example.com>>:389 ldap://<<master-3.example.com>>:389"
----
+


This updates the replica to be a multi-master replica, enabled with a
server ID. It is automatically configured to be a paired master with
the master it was previously replicating from.


== Deleting a Multi-Master Replication Node

To delete a multi-master replication (MMR) node, use the following
steps.

NOTE: Deleting an MMR node can only be performed in {product-abbrev}
8.0.7 and later.

. Update the `ldap_master_url` and `ldap_url` on every node, removing the
LDAP MMR node that will be shut down.
. Wait 5-10 minutes to ensure the modification is in place.
. Monitor `/var/log/zimbra.log` on the MMR node that will be shut down
and confirm it is no longer receiving modification traffic.
. Run `ldap stop` on the MMR node that is being shut down.
. Log into the remaining MMR nodes and perform the following:
.. `/opt/zimbra/libexec/zmldapmmrtool -q`
.. Find the matching _RID_ for the MMR node you shut down.
.. `/opt/zimbra/libexec/zmldapmmrtool -d -o RID`

=== Example of Deleting an MMR Node

The following is an example of using `zmldapmmrtool`.

. There are three MMR servers, `ldap-1.example.com`, `ldap-2.example.com`,
`ldap-3.example.com`, with `ldap-3.example.com` being shut down.
+
----
zimbra@ldap-1:/tmp/mmr$ ./zmldapmmrtool -q
Master replication information
Master replica 1
rid: 100 URI: ldap://ldap-2.example.com:389/ TLS: critical Master replica 2
rid: 101 URI: ldap://ldap-3.example.com:389/ TLS: critical
----
+
. The RID being used by `ldap-3.example.com` is `101`. This agreement can
be deleted with:
+
----
zimbra@ldap-1:/tmp/mmr$ ./zmldapmmrtool -d -o 101
----
+
. Confirm the deletion.
+
----
zimbra@ldap-1:/tmp/mmr$ ./zmldapmmrtool -q
Master replication information
Master replica 1
rid: 100 URI: ldap://ldap-2.example.com:389/ TLS: critical zimbra@ldap-1:/tmp/mmr
----
+
. Repeat on the remaining node(s).


== Monitoring Multiple LDAP Master Status

The _Monitoring LDAP Replication Status_ feature monitors the change
sequence number (CSN) values between an LDAP master server and an LDAP
replica server. The replica server is considered a shadow copy of the
master server. If the servers become out of sync, the monitoring
feature indicates the problem. The out of sync time period is
typically five minutes, although this value is configurable.

=== Feature Requirement

Run the script `zmreplchk` located in `/opt/zimbra/libexec`.

IMPORTANT: This script must be run on a {product-abbrev} server that has a
`localconfig` value set for `ldap_url` that includes all of the master
servers.


include::multi-server-ldap-error-codes.adoc[]

For example, `ldap-2.example.com` is the master server, and
`ldap-3.example.com` and `ldap-4.example`.com are additional
servers. The following screen-shot shows the additional master servers
are in sync with the master server, as indicated by the `Code:0` and
`Status: In Sync`, and master server `ldap005` is currently down, as
indicated by `Code: 4` and `Status: Server down`.
