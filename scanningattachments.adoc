## Scanning Attachments in Outgoing Mail
:toc:

You can enable real-time scanning of attachments in outgoing emails sent
using the Zimbra Web Client. If enabled, when an attachment is added to
an email, it is scanned using ClamAV prior to sending the message. If
ClamAV detects a virus, it will block attaching the file to the message.
By default, scanning is configured for a single node installation.

To enable using a single node:
[source%nowrap,bash]
....
zmprov mcf zimbraAttachmentsScanURL clam://localhost:3310/
zmprov mcf zimbraAttachmentsScanEnabled TRUE
....
