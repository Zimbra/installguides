= Installing {product-name} Software
:toc:

*Important:* Before you begin, make sure to:

* ({product-edition-commercial} Only) Store your license in a directory folder on
your server as it is needed to complete your installation of {product-name}
* Confirm you have the latest system requirements and prerequisites for
installing {product-name}.

Open an SSH session to the {product-short} server and follow the steps below:

1. Log in as root to the {product-short} server and cd to the directory where
   the {product-name} archive tar file is saved (cd /var/<tmp>). Type
   the following commands:
   * Unpack the file: `tar xvzf [zcsfullfilename.tgz]`
   * Change to the correct directory: `cd [zcsfullfilename]`
   * Begin the installation: `./install.sh`

2. The *install.sh* script reviews the installation software to verify that the
{product-short} packages are available. +
The installation process checks to see whether any of the applications
*Sendmail*, *Postfix*, *MySQL* or *MariaDB* are running.
If any of these applications are running,
you are asked to disable them. Disabling *MySQL* and *MariaDB* is *optional*
but highly recommended.
*Sendmail* and *Postfix must* be disabled for {product-name} to start correctly.
