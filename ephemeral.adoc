= Ephemeral Data Migration

Versions of {product-short} prior to {product-version} stored
_ephemeral data_ in _LDAP_.  Examples of _ephemeral data_ include:

* `zimbraAuthTokens`
* `zimbraCsrfTokenData`
* `zimbraLastLogonTimestamp`

{product-name} version {product-version} introduced the ability to
store _ephemeral data_ in an external service such as
http://ssdb.io/[SSDB]. This is an optional feature; however, it
can improve _LDAP_ performance and stability.

Please refer to the _{product-admin-guide}_ for more information.
Migration of _ephemeral data_ out of _LDAP_ and into _SSDB_  must be
performed after an install or upgrade has been completed.
