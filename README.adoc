===================================================================================================================================================

This repository contains the code necessary to build the Zimbra
Installation Guides.

These guides are intended for system administrators responsible for
installing, maintaining, and supporting the server deployment of
Zimbra.

Building the Documentation
--------------------------

The Zimbra Installation related guides are written using
link:http://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc]. Specifically, they are intended to be
processed with link:https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor].

As a prerequisite to building the documentation, you will need to have
already installed and configured
link:http://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor]. Check the
link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#installation-quick-start[Installation
Quick Start] in the
link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/[Asciidoctor User Manual] for
information on how to get started.

Once you have Asciidoctor installed and working, you can build the
documentation into HTML files, as in the following examples:

=== Zimbra Collaboration - Performing a Multi-Server Installation

Each section of each document is contained in its own file.
You may use the `multi-server-install.adoc` file to generate the entire
document.

==== HTML

[source,bash]
----
asciidoctor -b html5 -o {version}/multi.html multi-server-install.adoc
----

==== PDF

[source,bash]
----
asciidoctor-pdf -a allow-uri-read -o {version}/multi-server-install.pdf multi-server-install.adoc
----


=== Zimbra Collaboration - Performing a Single-Server Installation

Each section of each document is contained in its own file.
You may use the `index-single-server-install.adoc` file to generate the entire
document.

==== HTML

[source,bash]
----
asciidoctor -b html5 -o {version}/single.html index-single-server-install.adoc
----

==== PDF

[source,bash]
----
asciidoctor-pdf -a allow-uri-read -o {version}/single-server-install.pdf index-single-server-install.adoc
----



=== Zimbra Collaboration - Upgrade Guide

==== HTML

[source,bash]
----
asciidoctor -b html5 -o {version}/upgrade.html upgrade.adoc
----


==== PDF

[source,bash]
----
asciidoctor-pdf -o upgrade.pdf upgrade.adoc
----

When publishing the output (`gh-pages` branch) the "latest" link needs to be updated to point at the new version:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
-----
ln -nsf {product-version} latest
-----

IMPORTANT: Windows users need to launch Command Prompt with administrator privileges and use the command https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/cc753194(v%3dws.11)[mklink].

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
-----
mklink /D latest {product-version}
-----

TIP: The above command does not overwrite the existing symlink, hence first rename it.

Finally, the `index.html` file in the root folder needs to be updated to include appropriate links for the new version's documents.
Use your favorite text editor to complete this task before committing and pushing the updated `gh-pages` branch to the repo.
