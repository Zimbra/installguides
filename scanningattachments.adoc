= Scanning Attachments in Outgoing Mail
:toc:

You can enable real-time scanning of attachments in outgoing emails sent
using the {product-short} Web Client. If enabled, when an attachment is added to
an email, it is scanned using ClamAV prior to sending the message. If
ClamAV detects a virus, it will block attaching the file to the message.
By default, scanning is configured for a single node installation.

To enable using a single node:
[source%nowrap,bash]
....
zmprov mcf zimbraAttachmentsScanURL clam://localhost:3310/
zmprov mcf zimbraAttachmentsScanEnabled TRUE
....
