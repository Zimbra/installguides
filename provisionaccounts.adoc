[[Importing_Content_from_User_Mailboxes]]
== Importing Content from User Mailboxes

{product-provider} developed different applications to facilitate moving a user’s
email messages, calendars, and contacts from their old email servers to
their accounts on the {product-short} server. When the user’s files are imported,
the folder hierarchy is maintained. Use one of the {product-name}
utilities to move user mail to {product-name} to guarantee that
all information is imported correctly.

The following applications can be accessed from the administration
console **Download page**, and instruction guides are available from the
Help Desk page or from the {product-provider} Website, Documentation page.

Alternatively, you can download the following applications from
https://example.com/downloads/index.html (with “example.com” being your
{product-short} server name).

* **{product-name} Migration Wizard for Exchange**. Format is an .exe
file. You can migrate users from Microsoft® Exchange server email
accounts to {product-short} server accounts.
* **{product-name} Migration Wizard for Domino**. Format is an .exe
file. You can migrate users from Lotus Domino server email accounts to
{product-short} server accounts.
* **PST Import Wizard** (User Instructions). Format is an .exe file. Users
download the Import Wizard to their computers and run the executable
file to import their Outlook .pst files to the {product-short} server. Before
users run this utility, {product-provider} recommends that they run the Outlook
Inbox Repair tool, `scanpst.exe`, on their .pst files, to clean up any
errors in their file. For more information about this tool, go to
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/287497.

[[Administrators_Account]]
== Administrator Account

Initial administrative tasks when you log on for the first time may
include setting up the admin mailbox to include features, aliases, and
forwarding addresses needed for the administrator’s working environment.

Two aliases for the admin account are created during install:

* **Postmaster**. The postmaster address is displayed in emails that are
automatically generated from Postfix when messages cannot be sent. If
users reply to this address, the message is forwarded to the admin
mailbox.
* **Root**. This address is where notification messages from the
operating system are sent.

If you entered a notification address for AV alerts when you configured
the MTA, that is different from the default, you need to create that
account in the administration console. If you didn’t change the default
during installation, the anti-virus notification is sent directly to the
admin account.
