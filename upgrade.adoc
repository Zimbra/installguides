= {product-name} {product-version} Upgrade Steps

== Before you upgrade

The following tasks might need to be performed before you
upgrade. After you review the tasks in this section, go to Upgrade
Instructions. Be sure to read the
https://wiki.zimbra.com/index.php?title=Zimbra_Releases/8.7.0[release note] information before upgrading.

[NOTE]
====
https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=105056[Bug
105056]
noted a problem that can occur during a rolling upgrade if two
factor authentication (2FA) is enabled before all mailbox servers have
been upgraded to 8.7.  In particular, pre-8.7 mailbox servers are not
compatible with 2FA.

Accordingly, it is recommended that 2FA is not enabled until all
mailbox servers have been upgraded to 8.7.
====

=== Database Integrity Checking

Some customers have had corrupted databases prior to upgrade, and the
upgrade has in some of those cases exacerbated the problem. In order
to detect any corrupted databases as early as possible, we have added
an optional step to check the MariaDB database with
`zmdbintegrityreport` prior to making any system changes. You are
prompted to decide if you would like to run the zmdbintegrityreport.

`zmdbintegrityreport` can take minutes to an hour to run,
depending on your system size and disk bandwidth.

[NOTE]
====
`zmdbintegrityreport` is run on a weekly basis from cron on all
zimbra-store nodes. Large sites can opt to disable this by setting
`zmlocalconfig -e zmdbintegrityreport_disabled=TRUE`. If
you choose to disable this, it is recommended that the integrity
reports be run by hand during the your normal maintenance windows and
prior to running any {product-abbrev} upgrades.
====

=== Preparing your operating system

Before you upgrade {product-abbrev}, {product-provider} recommends that the operating system is
updated with the latest patches that have been tested with {product-abbrev}.

==== Ubuntu OS

* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Server Edition (64-bit)
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Server Edition (64-bit)
* Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS Server Edition running the saucy (3.11) or later
  kernel is required.
+
[CAUTION]
====
If the original install was done with Ubuntu 12.04.2 or earlier,
manual intervention is required to switch to the saucy (3.11) or later
kernel series. See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/LTSEnablementStack
for further information.
====
+
You can find your current kernel version by running:
+
----
uname -a
----
+
For example:
+
----
build@zre-ubuntu12-64:~$ uname -a
Linux zre-ubuntu12-64 3.11.0-17-generic #31~precise1-Ubuntu SMP Tue Feb 4
21:25:43 UTC 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
----
+


==== Red Hat Enterprise Linux/CentOS Linux

[IMPORTANT]
====
* If running the RHEL linux distribution, you must have a current valid
  license from RedHat.
* The server must have a valid yum or apt-get configuration so that it
  can reach the Zimbra package servers.
====

* Red Hat® Enterprise Linux® 7, AS/ES (64-bit) 
* CentOS Linux® 7 (64-bit)
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, AS/ES (64-bit), patch level 4 or later is required
* CentOS Linux 6 (64-bit), patch level 4 or later is required

=== License Activation

[IMPORTANT]
====
* At the beginning of an upgrade installation, the existing license is
  validated as being current and qualifies for the upgrade. If your
  license is expired, an error message displays and the upgrade cannot
  be performed. Contact {product-provider} Sales for a license renewal to continue
  your upgrade.
* An upgrade installation will not proceed without automatic
  activation or a manually activated license file. License activations
  are limited to five activations per license file. If you have
  previously used all activations prior to upgrading your production
  system, you must contact {product-provider} Sales to enable additional license
  activations.
====

All {product-edition-commercial} installations require a valid license and license
activation. New installs will have a 10 day grace period from the
license issue date before requiring activation.

License activation is automatic during the install with systems that
have external access to the {product-provider} license servers. A means of
creating manual activations will be provided for systems that do not
have external access to the {product-provider} license servers. See the
_{product-admin-guide}_ for more information.


When upgrading, the way in which ZCO and archiving licensing is
enforced might have changed on the server if you are using an older
version of {product-name}. Older licenses might have
`MAPIConnectorAccountsLimit` set to `0` or `ArchivingAccountsLimit` missing
in the license. Contact {product-provider} Sales for an updated license file prior
to upgrading if you have licensed either of these features and your
current license does not properly reflect the correct number.

=== Upgrading LDAP Replica Servers or Multi-Master Server

NOTE: These instructions apply to {product-abbrev} 8.0.0, 8.0.1, 8.0.2 to {product-abbrev}
8.0.4 and later.

If you have replica servers or are in multi-master mode, you have to
install the {product-short} _LDAP_ schema specific to the release you are
upgrading to onto the replica servers or onto the multi-master server
before you upgrade to {product-abbrev} 8.0.4 and later.
See https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=81048[Bug 81048].

.  On the master _LDAP_ server, perform a software installation only of
{product-abbrev} 8.0.4 and later.
+
----
./install.sh -s
----
+
. On each replica or additional master _LDAP_ server in MMR mode, as
the `zimbra` user:
.. Stop the server via one of the following commands:
... `ldap stop`
... `zmcontrol stop`
.. Move the `zimbra` schema out of the way
+
----
cd /opt/zimbra/data/ldap/config/cn=config/cn=schema
mv cn={4}zimbra.ldif /opt/zimbra/data/ldap/cn={4}zimbra.ldif.dead
----
+
.. Copy the schema from the master _LDAP_ server.
+
----
scp root@<master>:/opt/zimbra/openldap/etc/openldap/schema/zimbra.ldif cn={4}zimbra.ldif
----
+
.. Edit cn={4}zimbra.ldif to change the following two lines:
+
----
dn: cn=zimbra,cn=schema,cn=config     ------->     dn: cn={4}zimbra
cn: zimbra                            ------->     cn: {4}zimbra
----
+
.. Start the server via one of the following commands:
... `ldap start`
... `zmcontrol start`
. On the master _LDAP_ server run:
+
----
/opt/zimbra/libexec/zmsetup.pl
----
+
. On each replica server run:
+
----
 ./install.sh
----
+

To continue the upgrade, see <<_multi_server_environment_upgrade_steps>>.

=== Disable SSLv3 Support

If upgrading to {product-abbrev} 8.7.0, you need to completely disable SSLv3
support after the upgrade. Disabling SSLv3 is recommended as a result
of the SSLv3 vulnerability described in
https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA14-290A[Alert (TA14-290A)].


SSLv3 support has been deprecated by default in 8.6.0, although when
upgrading from previous versions of {product-abbrev}, some protocols might still be
enabled.

[NOTE]
====
* New keys created in {product-abbrev} 8.7.0 (or later) have SSLv3 disabled by default.
* Pre-existing keys from earlier versions of {product-abbrev} will still have SSLv3 enabled.
====

Follow the steps in the {product-provider} wiki article
https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/How_to_disable_SSLv3[How to Disable
SSLv3] to disable SSLv3 after upgrading to ZCS 8.7.0.

=== Update Default Proxy SSL Ciphers Attribute

Whenever upgrading, it is recommended that you check the values of the
following attributes (`zmprov gcf <attr>`) and compare them
with the current default values (`zmprov desc -a <attr>`).

----
zimbraReverseProxySSLCiphers
zimbraReverseProxySSLProtocols
zimbraSSLExcludeCipherSuites
zimbraMailboxdSSLProtocols
----

TIP: If you have not performed any recent hardening of your settings,
your config should already match the {product-abbrev} default; and no action would
be required.

In addition, it is recommended to make the following changes:

. Remove the following from `zimbraReverseProxySSLCiphers`:
+
----
ECDHE-RSA-RC4-SHA
ECDHE-ECDSA-RC4-SHA
RC4-SHA
----
+
. Add the following to `zimbraReverseProxySSLCiphers`:
+
----
!RC4
----
+

NOTE: See https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Cipher_suites for the most
current information on cipher suite configuration.

=== Customizing ZCO Installations

Administrators who want to customize the _ZCO_ installation MSI should
use the unsigned version of the MSI
(`ZimbraConnectorOLK_n.n.n.nnnn_xnn-unsigned.msi`), available in the
{product-provider} download directory. The modified MSI should then replace the
standard signed MSI (`ZimbraConnectorOLK_n.n.n.nnnn_xnn.msi`) in order
to be available to end users from `/downloads/index.html` and the _ZCO_
auto-upgrade process. (https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=85067[Bug 85067]).

== Upgrade Instructions

=== Download the Software

For {product-edition-commercial}, go to
http://www.zimbra.com/downloads/zimbra-collaboration to access the
software.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Before you begin the upgrade, make sure you have a good backup for
  all users!
* Database reloads are performed on 7.x to any 8.x upgrade.
====

When you run the install script, if {product-abbrev} is already installed, you will
be asked if you want to upgrade. Follow the instructions in this
release note to perform the upgrade. For additional information, refer
to the installation guide.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-provider} recommends that an install or upgrade session be run with a
UNIX command such as `screen` to help prevent an install or upgrade
session from terminating before it is completed. This is important
when the upgrade includes restoring a configuration that has a large
number of accounts.

Example command usage:
----
screen ./install.sh
----
====

=== Single Server Upgrade Steps

You do not need to stop the services before upgrading. The upgrade
process automatically stops and starts the services as required for
the upgrade.


include::upgrade-process-inc.adoc[]


=== Multi-Server Environment Upgrade Steps

Upgrade the servers in the following order. Update each server one at
a time, following the instructions under <<_process_2>> below.

. _LDAP_ master server. The _LDAP_ master servers must all be upgraded
  before proceeding, and they must be running as you upgrade the other
  servers.
. _LDAP_ replicas 
. _MTA_ servers - see <<_using_lmdb_as_the_supported_back_end_for_on_disk_database_maps>>.
. Proxy servers
. Mailstore servers 

include::upgrade-process-inc.adoc[]

=== Using LMDB as the Supported Back-end for On-disk Database Maps

[WARNING]
====
Starting with {product-abbrev} 8.5 and later, _Postfix_ is linked to _LMDB_, the same
back-end {product-abbrev} uses with _OpenLDAP_. Prior to {product-abbrev} 8.0, _Postfix_ was linked
to _Berkeley DB_.

{product-abbrev} has not officially supported using any _Postfix_ on-disk database
maps prior to {product-abbrev} 8.5. However, these have been used through custom
non-preserved modifications to the `postconf` configuration. These
modifications will be lost on upgrade.
====

To restore the modifications post-upgrade, the following steps need to
be performed:

. Run postmap against the database input file to generate an LMDB
database.
. It will be necessary to iterate through the postconf keys that have
`hash:/path/to/db` values and update them in LDAP to use
`lmdb:/path/to/db` values instead.

Many previously unsupported features that could be used with on-disk
database maps are now fully supported by {product-abbrev}. Check if your
customizations are correctly carried forward when
upgrading. See https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=77586[Bug
77586].

== After the Upgrade is Complete

After you completed the upgrade, the following might need to be
addressed.

* Review https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/How_to_disable_SSLv3[How to disable SSLv3].
* Review https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Cipher_suites[Cipher suites].
* During the upgrade process, {product-short} might make a binary backup of
  existing databases when there are major structural changes occurring
  to the database format for ease of downgrading. Administrators will
  want to clean these up once they have confirmed a successful
  upgrade. For _LDAP_ servers, these backups are in
  `/opt/zimbra/data/ldap`, and in the form of `<dbname>.prev.+++$$+++`
  where `+++$$+++` is the process
  ID of the upgrade script. See https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=81167[Bug 81167].
* You should run `zmldapupgrade -b 66387` after upgrading.  The
`zimbraAllowFromAddress` attribute cannot be set for internal accounts
 or distribution lists. Running this script will change
 `zimbraAllowFromAddress` values to grants.
+
[NOTE]
====
* This step was not included into the installer-driven upgrade due to
  potentially long delay for sites that set `zimbraAllowFromAddress` on
  many accounts.
* The migration command reports how many accounts had the
  `zimbraAllowFromAddress` attribute set and how many of
  them needed migration. One way to verify all accounts got migrated
  is to run the command again. The total won't change, and the number
  migrated should be 0. See
  https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=66387[Bug 66387] for
  more information.
====
+
* If your self-signed SSL certificates have expired, update them.
+
[NOTE]
====
To check for expired certificates, run the following command as the
`zimbra` user:
----
/opt/zimbra/libexec/zmcheckexpiredcerts -days 1 -verbose
----
{product-name} requires a valid self-signed or commercial SSL
certificate for communication between some components. The self-signed
certificates that are automatically created by the 
{product-short} install have a default expiration.

If you have a {product-name} installation that is over one year
old and are using self-signed certificates, your certificates will
need to be updated either prior to the upgrade or immediately
following the upgrade.

After you upgrade, the following commands run as the zimbra user will
regenerate the self-signed SSL certificates:

----
sudo /opt/zimbra/bin/zmcertmgr createca -new
sudo /opt/zimbra/bin/zmcertmgr deployca
sudo /opt/zimbra/bin/zmcertmgr deploycrt self -new
----
====
+
* If you were using `zmlogger` prior to {product-abbrev} 8.0.7, it is
  possible that numerous `rdd` files could be generated causing large
  amounts of disk space to be used. {product-abbrev} 8.0.7 and later
  contain a patch that prevents future additional growth of `rdd` files
  on the logger server. To clean up existing `rdd` files, use the
  following script to remove `rdd` files from your server.
  See https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=85222[Bug 85222].
+
----
sudo su - zimbra
zmloggerctl stop
cd /opt/zimbra/logger/db/data

for nhostid in $(sqlite3 /opt/zimbra/logger/db/data/logger.sqlitedb 'select
id from hosts'); do for ID in $(sqlite3 logger.sqlitedb "select rrd_file, col_name_19 from rrds Where csv_file == 'imap.csv' and host_id == ${nhostid}" | egrep "__[0-9]+$" | cut -d'|' -f1 | sort -n | uniq); do mv rrds/${nhostid}-$ID.rrd /opt/zimbra/logger/db/data/wrong_rrds/; done ; done

for mon in {1..12}; do MON=$(LANG=en_US; date +%b -d 2013-${mon}-01); sqlite3 logger.sqlitedb "DELETE FROM rrds WHERE col_name_19 LIKE '${MON}_%'"; done

sqlite3 logger.sqlitedb "VACUUM;"

zmloggerctl start
rm -R /opt/zimbra/logger/db/data/wrong_rrds
rm /opt/zimbra/logger/db/data/logger.sqlitedb.backup
----
+
* If you have configured the following keys, you will need to replace
  them as described here.
+
====
The following keys are deprecated:

----
httpclient_client_connection_timeout
httpclient_connmgr_connection_timeout
httpclient_connmgr_idle_reaper_connection_timeout
httpclient_connmgr_idle_reaper_sleep_interval
httpclient_connmgr_keepalive_connections
httpclient_connmgr_max_host_connections
httpclient_connmgr_max_total_connections
httpclient_connmgr_so_timeout
httpclient_connmgr_tcp_nodelay
----

They are replaced by the following keys:

----
httpclient_internal_client_connection_timeout
httpclient_internal_connmgr_connection_timeout
httpclient_internal_connmgr_idle_reaper_connection_timeout
httpclient_internal_connmgr_idle_reaper_sleep_interval
httpclient_internal_connmgr_keepalive_connections
httpclient_internal_connmgr_max_host_connections
httpclient_internal_connmgr_max_total_connections
httpclient_internal_connmgr_so_timeout
httpclient_internal_connmgr_tcp_nodelay
httpclient_external_client_connection_timeout
httpclient_external_connmgr_connection_timeout
httpclient_external_connmgr_idle_reaper_connection_timeout
httpclient_external_connmgr_idle_reaper_sleep_interval
httpclient_external_connmgr_keepalive_connections
httpclient_external_connmgr_max_host_connections
httpclient_external_connmgr_max_total_connections
httpclient_external_connmgr_so_timeout

== Remove Current Version and Perform Clean Install of ZCS

If you do not want to upgrade, but prefer to install {product-name}
{product-edition-commercial} as a new installation, when you run the
{product-name} {product-edition-commercial} install script, enter `N` when asked
`Do you wish to upgrade?`

WARNING: A warning displays asking if you want to delete all existing
users and mail. If you enter `Yes`, all users, mail, and
previous files are removed before proceeding with the new
installation. Refer to the installation guides for installation
instructions.

== Status of Your Customization after Upgrade

Upgrading to the newest release does not delete your accounts or
change your configuration.  Configuration settings stored in _LDAP_ and
_localconfig_ are preserved during upgrades. Any files installed by
{product-name} might be deprecated and/or overwritten during
upgrades, removing any customizations. This includes customized
themes, logo branding changes, and crontab changes.  Only the core
Zimlets are enabled after the upgrade. Zimlets that you customized
and/or deployed are preserved during the upgrade but will be
disabled. As upgrading of customized Zimlets cannot be tested before
the release, {product-provider} recommends that you verify that your customized
Zimlets work correctly before re-enabling them for your end-users
after the upgrade.

NOTE: When upgrading to {product-name} 8.5.x and later from a
previous major {product-abbrev} version, the upgrade step disables Zimlets that are
not the core Zimlets for {product-abbrev} in all COSs. If you have enabled other
Zimlets at the account level, you might need to manually disable these
Zimlets. See https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=77836[Bug 77836].

All entries between the designated comments in the {product-short}
crontab file are overwritten with new defaults upon
upgrade. Customized backup schedules stored in the {product-short} crontab and
customizations to the crontab entry outside the designated comments
are preserved.

== Changes to Customized Themes

[WARNING]
====
In {product-name} 8.5.x and later, a new design for default skins was
implemented. Custom skins created for {product-short} 7.x might not
work as intended with {product-name} 8.5.x and later. Depending on
what is in the skin, the issues might range from simple things such as
colors being used in the wrong places to larger issues like functional
components being hidden or placed in inaccessible areas of the
screen. The proper fix for this is to take an existing 8.5.x or later
skin, duplicate it, and update the skin to meet the same needs as the
old skin. See https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=62523[Bug
62523].
