= Configuring LDAP Replication

== Configuring LDAP Replication Overview

Setting up LDAP replication lets you distribute {product-short} server
queries to specific replica LDAP servers. Only one master LDAP server
can be set up. This server is authoritative for user information,
server configuration, etc. Replica LDAP servers can be defined to
improve performance and to reduce the load on the master server. All
updates are made to the master server and these updates are copied to
the replica servers.

The {product-short} install program is used to configure a master LDAP
server and additional read-only replica LDAP servers. The master LDAP
server is installed and configured first, following the normal
{product-abbrev} installation options. The LDAP replica server
installation is modified to point the replica server to the LDAP
master host.

When the master LDAP server and the replica LDAP servers are correctly
installed, the following is automatically configured:

* SSH keys are set up on each LDAP server.
* Trusted authentication between the master LDAP and the LDAP replica
servers is set up.
* The content of the master LDAP directory is copied to the replica
LDAP server. Replica LDAP servers are read-only.
* {product-short} servers are configured to query the replica LDAP
server instead of the master LDAP server.

== Installing Zimbra Master LDAP Server

You must install the master LDAP server before you can install replica
LDAP servers. Refer to <<install_ldap_master>>
for master LDAP server installation instructions. After the
installation of the master LDAP server has completed, continue
to <<_enable_replication_on_the_ldap_master>>.

== Enable Replication on the LDAP Master

On the master LDAP server, as the `zimbra` user, type:
`/opt/zimbra/libexec/ zmldapenablereplica` and press _Enter_. This enables
replication on the LDAP Master.

== Installing a Replica LDAP Server

The master LDAP server must be running when you install the replica
server. You run the {product-abbrev} install program on the replica
server to install the LDAP package.

Follow steps 1 through 4 in <<starting_multiple_server_install>>
to open a SSH session to the LDAP server, log on to the server
as root, and unpack the {product-short} software.

. Type `Y` and press _Enter_ to install the `zimbra-ldap` package. In the

NOTE: All passwords must be set to match the master ldap admin user
password. To determine this value on the master LDAP server, run
`zmlocalconfig -s ldap_replication_password`
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you have installed {product-short} MTA on the LDAP
server, configure the Amavis and the Postfix passwords. To find these
values, issue the following commands:

----
zmlocalconfig -s ldap_amavis_password
zmlocalconfig -s ldap_postfix_password

=== Test the Replica

. Create several user accounts, either from the admin console or on
the master LDAP server. The CLI command to create these accounts is
+
----
zmprov ca <name@domain.com> <password>
----
+
If you do not have a mailbox server setup, you can create domains
instead. Use this CLI command to create a domain
+
----
zmprov cd <domain name>
----
+
. To see if the accounts were correctly copied to the replica LDAP
server, on the replica LDAP server, type `zmprov -l gaa`.
Type `zmprov gad` to check all domains.
The accounts/domains created on the master
LDAP server should display on the replica LDAP server.


In cases where the mailbox server is not setup, you can also use the
following command for account creation.

----
zmprov ca <name@domain> <password> zimbraMailTransport <where_to_deliver>
----


== Configuring {product-short} Servers to Use LDAP Replica

To use the replica LDAP server instead of the master LDAP server, you
must update the `ldap_url` value on the {product-short} servers that will query
the replica instead of the master. For each server that you want to
change:

. Stop the {product-short} services on the server. Type `zmcontrol stop`.
. Update the `ldap_url` value. Enter the replica LDAP server URL
+
----
zmlocalconfig -e ldap_url="ldap://<replicahost> ldap://<masterhost>"
----
+
Enter more than one replica hostnames in the list typed as
+
----
"ldap://<replicahost1> ldap://<replicahost2> ldap://<masterhost>"
----
+
The hosts are tried in the order listed. The master URL _must_ always be
included and is listed _last_.
+
. Update the `ldap_master_url` value. Enter the master LDAP server URL,
if not already set.
+
----
zmlocalconfig -e ldap_master_url=ldap://<masterhost>:port
----
+



[IMPORTANT]
====
Additional Steps for MTA hosts. After updating the `ldap_url`, rerun
`/opt/zimbra/ libexec/zmmtainit`.  This rewrites the Postfix
configuration with the updated `ldap_url`.
====


== Uninstalling an LDAP Replica Server

If you do not want to use an LDAP replica server, follow these steps
to disable it.

NOTE: Uninstalling an LDAP server is the same as disabling it on the
master LDAP server.

=== Remove LDAP Replica from All Active Servers

. On each member server, including the replica, verify the `ldap_url`
value. Type	`zmlocalconfig [ldap_url]`.
. Remove the disabled LDAP replica server URL from `zmlocalconfig`. Do
this by modifying the `ldap_url` to only include enabled
{product-abbrev} LDAP servers.
+
IMPORTANT: The master LDAP server should always be
at the end of the `ldap_url` string value.
+
----
zmlocalconfig -e ldap_url="ldap://<replica-server-host> ldap://<master-server-host>"
----
+


=== Disable LDAP on the Replica

To disable LDAP on the replica server:

. Type `zmcontrol stop` to stop the {product-short} services on the
server.
. To disable LDAP service, type
+
----
zmprov -l ms <zmhostname> -zimbraServiceEnabled ldap
----
+
. Type `zmcontrol start` to start other current {product-short} services on the
server.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Additional steps for MTA host. After updating the `ldap_url` with
`zmlocalconfig`, rerun `/opt/zimbra/libexec/zmmtainit`. This rewrites the
Postfix configuration with the updated `ldap_url`.
====

== Monitoring LDAP Replication Status

The _Monitoring LDAP Replication Status_ feature monitors the change
sequence number (CSN) values between an LDAP master server and an LDAP
replica server. The replica server is considered a shadow copy of the
master server. If the servers become out of sync, the monitoring
feature indicates the problem. The out of sync time period is
typically five minutes, although this value is configurable.

=== Feature Requirement

Run the script `zmreplchk` located in `/opt/zimbra/libexec`.

IMPORTANT: This script must be run on a {product-abbrev} server that has a
`localconfig` value set for `ldap_url` that includes all of the replica
servers and ends with the master server.


include::multi-server-ldap-error-codes.adoc[]

For example, `ldap-2.example.com` is the master server, and
`ldap-3.example.com` and `ldap-4.example.com` are replicas servers. The
following screen-shot shows that replica server `ldap-3` is in sync
with the master server, as indicated by the `Code:0` and `Status: In
Sync`, and replica server `ldap-4` is currently down, as indicated by
`Code: 4` and `Status: Server down`.

----
zimbra@ldap-2.example.com
Replica: ldap://ldap-3.example.com:389 Code: 0 Status: In Sync
Replica: ldap://ldap-4.example.com:389 Code: 4 Status: Server down
----

If the replica server becomes out of sync with the master server, the
status given indicates in a time format how far behind the master
server it has become:

----
Replica: ldap://ldap-3.example.com:389 Code: 0 Status: In Sync
Replica: ldap://ldap-4.example.com:389 Code: 6 Status: 0w 0d 0h 14m 42s behind
