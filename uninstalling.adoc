:toc:

To uninstall servers, run the install script -u, delete the
{product-name} directory, and remove the zcs.tgz file on the servers.

1. cd to the original install directory for the {product-name} files.

2. Type `sudo ./install.sh -u`

3. When `Completely remove existing installation?` is displayed, type
   `Yes`.
The {product-short} servers are stopped, the existing packages, webapp
directories, and most of the contents of the `/opt/zimbra` directory
are removed.

4. Type `rm -rf [zcsfullfilename]` to delete the {product-name} directory.

5. Delete the zcs.tgz file.
