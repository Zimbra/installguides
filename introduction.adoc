= Introduction

{product-name} includes the {product-provider} _MTA_, the
{product-provider} _LDAP_ server, and the {product-provider} _mailbox_
server.  In a single-server installation, all components are installed
on one server and require no additional manual configuration.

This installation guide is a quick start guide that describes the
basic steps needed to install and configure {product-name} in a direct
network connect environment. In this environment, the {product-short}
server is assigned a domain for which it receives mail, and a direct
network connection to the Internet.  When {product-name} is installed,
you will be able to log on to the {product-short} administration
console to manage the domain and provision accounts.  The accounts you
create are able to send and receive external email.

== Important Notice About Single Server Installations

{product-name} is designed to be the only application suite installed
on the server.  As part of the installation process, {product-name}
bundles and installs various other third party and open source
software, including http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/[Eclipse Jetty],
http://www.postfix.org/[Postfix], and https://www.openldap.org/[OpenLDAPÂ®].  The
versions installed have been tested and configured to work with {product-short}
software. See the {product-name} Administrator Guide for a complete
list of software.

A {product-short} license is required in order to create accounts on
servers running {product-name} {product-edition-commercial}.
You cannot install {product-name} Network Edition without a license.

The following table shows the default port settings when {product-name} is installed.

**Important:** You cannot have any other web server, database, _LDAP_,
or _MTA_ server running, when you install {product-name}. If you have
installed any of those applications before you install {product-short}
software, disable them.  During {product-name} installation,
{product-short} makes global system changes that may break
applications that are on your server.
