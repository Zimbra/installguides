== Modifying Operating System Configurations
:toc:

{product-name} runs on one of several operating systems, including
Ubuntu® LTS, Red Hat® Enterprise Linux, and SUSE® Linux Enterprise.

// TODO the 8.7 Multi-Server Installation guide included this text:
// Installation modifications for frequently used operating systems
// are described in individual configuration documents found on the
// {product-abbrev} documentation website, such as Installation Modifications
// for ZCS with Ubuntu LTS, or Installation Modifications for ZCS
// with Red Hat. Other operating systems may require similar
// modifications, and you can use the information contained in these
// documents as a reference to gauge whether your operating system
// might need to be modified.
// No such documentation exists for 8.7.  Hence commenting out this
// whole section as it doesn't make sense without that.
// However, in the archive documentation for release 7.2 at
// https://www.zimbra.com/documentation/zimbra-collaboration-network-edition/
// you can find:
// https://files.zimbra.com/website/docs/7.2/ZCS_Ubuntu_Server_Config.pdf
// https://files.zimbra.com/website/docs/7.2/ZCS_RedHat_Server_Config.pdf

A full default installation of the Linux distribution that you select is
required.

[IMPORTANT]
{product-provider} recommends that the operating systems you use are updated
