  . Log in as `root` to the {product-short} server and `cd` to the
    directory where the {product-abbrev} {product-edition-commercial} archive tar file is saved.
    For example, `cd /var/tmp`. Then type the following commands:
+
====
Unpack the file
----
tar xzvf zcs.tgz
----
Change to the correct directory.
----

  . The upgrade script checks if `proxy` and `memcached` are
    present. If both are found, the upgrade will proceed. If either are
    missing then the upgrade will abort and alert.
+
[NOTE]
====
* From 8.7.0 onwards proxy and memcached are required.
* See https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Enabling_Zimbra_Proxy_and_memcached#Using_existing_servers[Enabling Zimbra Proxy and memcached]

  . The {product-short} software agreement is displayed. Read this software
    license agreement and type `Y`.
  . When `Use Zimbra's packaging server [Y]` is displayed, press `enter`
    to continue. Your system will be configured to add the Zimbra
    packaging repository for '_yum'_ or _apt-get_ so it can install the
    Zimbra third party packages.
  . When `Do you wish to upgrade? [Y]` is displayed, press `enter` to
    continue. The upgrade packages are unpacked.
  . The packages are listed. The installer also lists packages that are
    not installed. If you want to install the packages at this time, type
    `Y`; otherwise press `enter`. The upgrade checks that there is enough
    space to perform the upgrade. If there is not enough space, the
    upgrade stops.
  . When `The system will be modified. Continue? [N]` is displayed, type
    `Y` and press `enter`. The {product-short} server is stopped, and the older
    packages are removed. The upgrade process verifies which version of
    ZCS is being run and proceeds to upgrade the services, restores the
    existing configuration files, and restarts the server. If you have a
    configuration with a large number of accounts created, this can take a
    while.
  . If you have not set the time zone, you will be asked to set it. This
    sets the time zone in the default COS. The time zone that should be
    entered is the time zone that the majority of users in the COS will be
    located in.
  . When Configuration complete, press `enter`.
  . After all _MTA_ nodes are upgraded to {product-name}
