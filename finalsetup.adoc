After the {product-name} servers are configured, the following functions
must be configured.

IMPORTANT: {product-name} supports the default syslog of a
supported operating system. Depending on your operating system, the
steps contained in this section might not be correct. See your
operating system documentation for specific information about how to
enable syslog.

If *zimbra-logger* is installed, set up the **syslog** configuration files
to enable server statistics to display on the administration console, and
enable the logger monitor host. The server statistics includes
information about the message count, message volume, and anti-spam and
anti-virus activity.

== Access to the 'zimbra' user

{product-name} ships a default `zimbra` user with a disabled
password.
{product-name} requires access to this account via
**ssh public key authentication**.
On most operating systems this combination is okay, but if you have
modified pam rules to disallow any ssh access to disabled accounts
then you must define a password for the `zimbra` UNIX account.
This will allow ssh key authentication for checking remote
queues. See the Zimbra wiki article,
https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Mail_Queue_Monitoring[Mail Queue Monitoring].

*Set up the ssh keys.* To populate the ssh keys

[source%nowrap,bash]
....
sudo -u zimbra -i # if not already logged in as the zimbra user
zmupdateauthkeys
....

The key is updated on `/opt/zimbra/.ssh/authorized_keys`

*Enabling Server Statistics Display.* In order for the server statistics
to display on the administration console, the syslog configuration files
must be modified. 
[NOTE]
Note, your system may use a different provider for the syslog service.

1. As **root**, type the following command to enable the server to display
   statistics - `/opt/zimbra/libexec/zmsyslogsetup`
2. You must enable syslog to log statistics from remote machines.
    RedHat Systems::
        * Edit the `/etc/sysconfig/syslog` file to add -r to the SYSLOGD_OPTIONS
        setting, `SYSLOGD_options="-r -m 0"`
        * Stop the syslog daemon - `/etc/init.d/syslog stop`
        * Start the syslog daemon - `/etc/init.d/syslog start`
    Debian and Ubuntu Systems::
        * Edit the `/etc/default/syslogd` file to add -r to the SYSLOGD_OPTIONS
        setting, `SYSLOGD_options="-r -m 0"`
        * Stop the syslog daemon -  `/etc/init.d/sysklogd stop`
        * Start the syslog daemon - `/etc/init.d/sysklogd start`
