= Zimbra Network NG Modules: First Steps

This guides contains all information needed in order to switch to the new Zimbra Network NG modules from their legacy counterparts after upgrading to Zimbra 8.8.

[[backup-ng]]
Switching to Backup NG
----------------------
Switching to the new Backup NG is a simple process that will initialize the
new backup system on a dedicated path.
Until the initialization is completed, the old backup engine will be active.
Old backup files will not be removed and the old backup and restore tools are
still available via the usual CLI commands.

[[backup-path-limitations]]
Backup Path Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to hold Backup NG data, a storage must comply to the following:

* The storage must have a mountpoint on the system.
** The "zimbra" user must of course have r/w permission on the path.
* The data must be stored on a case-sensitive filesystem.

Other than this, there are no hard limitations.

[[backup-ng-initialisation]]
Backup NG Initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before initializing the Backup NG module, make sure you have enough space on
the storage you wish to store the backup in. The average size of the backup is
50-70% of the nominal total quota of all mailboxes.

To initialize the Backup NG module:

* Access the Zimbra Administration Console.
* Enter the "Network Modules NG" section on the left menu.
* Enter the "Backup" section.
* Set the "Backup Path" to whatever directory you wish to store your backup into.
* Click on the "Initialize" button

[[mobile-ng]]
Switching to Mobile NG
----------------------
Switching to the new Mobile NG is a simple process that will activate the new
mobile handlers, deactivate the old ones and switch the synchronization control
over to Mobile NG from the legacy Zimbra Mobile.
Until the initialization is completed, the old mobile engine will be active.

[[what-happens-after-the-switch]]
What happens after the switch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After switching to Mobile NG, all existing syncstates will be invalidated,
and all connected devices will automatically re-synchronize all of their data
through the new engine.

WARNING: Since the switch will force all connected devices to re-synchonize all
of their data, make sure to alert your users beforehand to make sure that they have
wifi coverage or enough traffic on their mobile data plans.

The switch is completely transparent to end users, and no user interaction
 will be prompted or required.

[[mobile-ng-initialisation]]
Mobile NG Initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To initialize the Mobile NG module:

* Access the Zimbra Administration Console.
* Enter the "Network Modules NG" section on the left menu.
* Enter the "Mobile" section.
* Click on the "Activate" button.

[[hsm-ng]]
Switching to HSM NG
-------------------
The HSM NG module will become active as soon as the upgrade to Zimbra 8.8 is
completed, and does not require any interaction.

Any old HSM policy, volume and volume configuration will be maintained.

[[admin-ng]]
Switching to Admin NG
---------------------
Switching to the new Admin NG module is a simple process that will migrate any
relevant ACL information to the module's own configuration manager, clearing
existing ACLs and ACEs from the system.

The Admin NG module is significantly different than the old Delegated Administration engine.
Please make sure to read the product's documentation and to only migrate to Admin NG if its feature set
meets your needs.

WARNING: Admin Migration is a one way only process. Once Admin NG is initialized
it's not possible to go back to the old engine, so if you have customized or complex
ACLs/ACEs consider whether switching or not carefully.
